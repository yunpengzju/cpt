Idea: 10/10 [The overall project idea, as it was implemented.]
  - CPT site, group of 2

Functionality: 18/20 [The functionality that was implemented.  Both features and quality were evaluated.]
  - I'm not sure the workflow makes sense, but I'm willing to assume that's because I don't know how CPT works
  - decent set of functionality finished.

Polish: 7/10 [The functionality that was implemented.  Both features and quality were evaluated.]
  - too many form fields to easily work with; incorrect values can throw exceptions
  - no indication of date format (or even better, a date picker)
  - again, difficult to evaluate because I don't understand the problem

Technical style: 8/10 [Overall review of how things were implemented: coding style etc.]
  - shouldn't catch any exception, just ones you can handle. "except:" should be "except ValueError:"
  - X.state should have choices=[] set (then can display with c.get_state_display)
  - minor validation problems
